# Dice-Game
A dice game inspired by a tutorial I did by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The tutorial included 3 challenges: adding a rule where if you roll a 6 twice in a row you lose your points and your turn, add a Final Score input, and add a second dice. 
After completing the challenges, I decided to extended the game's functionality by adding a rules button and modal, and a number of dice selection, where the player can choose between rolling 1 or 2 dice.
